Step 1: Add water to a non-stick skillet until it reaches about 1/4
inch deep. Heat skillet over medium heat
 You'll want the water to cover the egg white and reach just
to the egg yolk.
 You don't want the water to cover the egg yolk at all.
Step 2: Break the egg and add to the skillet, when the water
 begins to bubble slightly.
Step 3: Using a large spoon, ladle water atop the egg white if the 
water begins to reduce while cooking.
Step 4: Cook until the egg white is perfectly opaque and the egg
 is firm as you shake the skillet slightly.
Step 5: Use a slotted spatula and carefully lift the egg from the
skillet,allowing any of the water to drain
from the egg before plating.
